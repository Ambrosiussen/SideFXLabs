You can drag and drop colors from the color palette to assign it to a node.
Are your cook times getting slow? Use the performance monitor to see where the bottleneck is. Find it under Window>Performance Monitor.

Press F1 while hovering a VEX function to bring the help page for it.
Holding CMD or CTRL while changing a nodes shape will set that shape as the default for all nodes of that type.
CTRL+LMB on a node to bring up the info panel; Click on an attribute on it to create a visualizer in the viewport.
CTRL+LMB on the color palette with a node selected will set all nodes of that types default color.
ALT+Shit+M Opens the cache manager where you can clear various caches.
ALT+LMB on a wire in the network editor will make a connector dot. Hold ALT while dragging the dot over multiple lines to 'collect' them into the same connector.
Pressing SHIFT+ENTER after creating a node using the tab menu will connect the created node to the node with the display flag set to it.
CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Dragging a node will create a reference copy. This means all parameters are referenced from the copied node.
"Use `opinputpath("".."",0)` is a useful expression to get the path of the node attached to the input of the node this expression gets evaluated on. The digit in the expression controls which input to check for."
Want to have a global position of an object (for example for exporting a camera that's driven by nulls) use the vtorigin and the vrorigin code
Dragging MMB to pick up color out of Houdini
You can copy a node in the network view then paste in any text field to get its path
"When working in a network view with the parameters floating in the corner, press alt-3 to make the parameters fill the pane (to edit VEX), alt-2 to go back"
Press 'P' with your mouse in the Network View to open a corner-mounted Parameters window (and it's resizable too!)
Shift+RMB over any parameter to toggle between the changed value and the previous value.
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+LMB over menu or shelf items to directly open the Hotkey Editor and highlight that command. This will only work for items that have hotkey support built-in.
"When selecting geometry, instead of pressing Enter to confirm the selection, you can press Shift+RMB."
"Alt+Shift+LMB a node to select everything upstream, Alt+Ctrl+LMB for downstream, Alt+Ctrl+Shift+LMB for the whole tree."
Shift+/ launches a Fast Find Node tool.
Use underscores to organise large numbers. For e.g. 10000000 can be written as 10_000_000 for clarity.
Object merge paths in sop solvers are a bit weird. Drag the dop object from the dop spreadsheet instead of typing and the path will always be correct (colon included)
The Box and Sphere sop inputs are used as bounding box sources to control the size of the generated box or sphere geometry.
You can drag and drop CHOPs into parameters for the easy creation of channel references
The sprite sop is a really efficient and cheap way to visualize pscale of points/particles without copying geometry
Want to impress your friends and work like a Pro. Hit Tab in a viewport and run the Toggle Stowbars tool. Run it again to get back to normal.
Press L while your mouse hovers the network editor to automatically organize your network
Press Shift+S in the network editor to change the drawing style of the network wires.
"In a Tab menu, type the first capital letters instead of writing the full tool name. acre, will get you ""Attribute Create"""
"To find the center point of a polygon (or polygons), Use the convert node set to ""Circle"" followed by an Add node set to ""Delete Geometry But Keep the Points""."
"Add an Attribute Delete before your caches to delete any attributes you aren't using. This will make your cache run faster, and clean up your simulation!"
you can use the 'vexprofile' hscript command to profile vex code
"in Edit Parameter Interface shift + click on ""+"" icon will collapse all folders and subfolders"
Connected two nodes to a merge/switch/etc node in the wrong order? Use Shift+R to rearrange them.
"To merge node, select two or more nodes, grab one of their outputs while holding ALT, now release the mouse. Tadaa!"
Use $F (frame number) in nodes to quickly change between different values using timeline (or as toggle in Switch node)
"To control Distance parameter of the PolyBevel node, pick from its drop-down set to Scale By Attribute and use ""pscale"" attribute."
Drag your light or camera to the viewport to look through it.  Also press \ to toggle between current and previous view
"Make use of the community actively.  SideFX Forum, Reddit, ODforce, RealTimeVFX, Discord, or your local SNS, and more."
"To setup camera focus properly, attach a grid perpendicular to the camera and link its Y axis to the focus distance."
Maximize working areas by hiding your stowbars! Tab -> Toggle Stowbars in the Network View.
"right click a node and go to ""spreadsheet"" to pop open a geometry spreadsheet window for that node."
Use the lock function on a null to prevent all the nodes above it being continually re-calculated (this needs testing but it used to work)
Need weighted randomized attributes? Attribute randomize can do that when distribution mode is set to Custom Discrete.
The Group Promote surface node can convert several groups into a single attribute with a unique integer value for each group.
Save space on disk by compressing your volumes with the Volume Compress node! You can almost always get away with writing 16-bit volumes. (use the Primitive node to set VDBs to write as 16-bit)
