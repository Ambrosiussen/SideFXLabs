III. Materials

Materials will be rendered by the VAT ROP as .mat files. The material parameters under the Houdini VAT - Data group will automatically filled in. You should probably just use SideFX/VAT_... shader graphs as templates. Duplicate the VAT shader graph, make your own modifications based on your needs, and re-parent the material to your customized shader.
