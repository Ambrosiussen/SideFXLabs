1. Make sure there is a Plugins folder next to the Content folder in your Unreal project directory. If the Plugins folder does not already exist, create one. (Your project directory is where the <YourProjectName>.uproject file is located.)

2. Copy the SideFX_Labs folder next to this text file and paste it inside the Plugins folder mentioned in the previous step. (The SideFX_Labs folder is where the SideFX_Labs.uplugin file is located.)

3. Your plugin is now ready. Launch your Unreal project and you should immediately have access to the Material Functions, Scripted Actions, etc. provided by the plugin. (With the project open, you can verify the plugin is successfully enabled by searching for "SideFX Labs" in Edit > Plugins.)
