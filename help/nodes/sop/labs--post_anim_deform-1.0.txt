<Description goes here>
This node provides a method of applying modeling changes to deforming geometery.
The modeling changes will move with the deforming geometry, in a predicable way.
This node can be used for "finaling" workflows. Rather than resimulate a cloth
or skin simulation you can make adjustments with this node and blend them back into
the original animation.

Note: in order for this node to work it needs to have a normal attribute and the polygons 
can not be degenerate.

@parameters

    Normal Attribute:
        #id: normal
             This specifys the incoming normal attribute the node should be using. This
             is used to compute the appropriate transformation matricies. 
        
    Transform Attribute:
        #id: trans_attrib
             The node uses an internaly created attribute to transform the geometry. 
             The default value uses the nodes name to minimize the chances of there being
             a naming conflict with an incoming attribute
        
    Attributes To Transform:
        #id: attrib_2_trans
             Here we can specifiy which attributes need to be transformed. The defaults assume
             That you want to transform the position and normal.
        
    Delete Transform Attribute:
        #id: deletexform
             option to delete or preserve the transformation attribute. Note: You might want
             to apply the transformation after the fact in combination with other transformations
             which is why you might want to perserve the attribute and not transform the geometry. 
             

    Transform Geometry:
        #id: transform_geo
             option to apply the transformation or not.
