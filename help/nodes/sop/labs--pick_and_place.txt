""" Allows you to interactively place individual objects in a scene. """

Pick and Place is an interactive tool that allows you to "Pick and Place" objects in a scene. The first input of the tool has the incoming collision geometry (your scene), and the second input has the objects you would like to place.
Once you enter the state of the tool (select the node and hit enter in the viewport), you can click and drag on the objects in the scene to place, scale and rotate them.

It is highly recommended you plug in packed primitives as the geometry to place.


TIP:
    Rightclick in the viewport while being in the tool state to change the behavior on scaling and rotating.

        This controls if the placed object gets aligned to the surface it got placed on.
